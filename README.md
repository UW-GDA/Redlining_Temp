## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the association between redlining policy

## Background
The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) created maps to classify neighborhoods into four grades - "Grade A" being considered the best (green), "Grade B" still desirable (blue), "Grade C" declining (yellow), and "Grade D" considered red. Historical redlining defined the riskiness of investing in urban neighborhoods based on demographics, infrastructure, housing quality, neighborhood stability, and proximity to amenities or hazards. (Winling & Minchney, 2021). Thus, **Redlining** has been regarded as a racially discriminant government policy that denied people access to credit and housing based on their race.
